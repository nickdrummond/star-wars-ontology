Events

Refactor events to have a date, location, participants etc - more flexible use for battles, deaths, trades, abductions, anything?
This will allow more storytelling and linking to other events

Eg death
OWK killedBy Darth Vader
OWK died 0
A bit weak as it doesn't link the 2 things together or tell you how or where

OB1-> killedDuring some (Duel and against value Darth_Vader and on value Death_Star_1 and date value 0)

But, we lose the simple inference that Darth Vader killed Obi Wan unless we put in property chains for these
and keep these other simpler properties

But we can query for them
killedDuring some (date value 0)
diedDuring some (Fight)
diedDuring some (against value Darth_Vader) - sounds weird
diedDuring some (on value Death_Star_1) - slightly weird

Can ask for events in a place? No, at these are not named events
Event and on value Death_Star_1 = nothing unless we name the event = lots more individuals!! (scalable?)
I suppose it shows up in the usage of Death Star though

Remove the event from OB1 completely too

ObiDeath Type Duel
on DeathStar1
victor DV
killed Ob1
date 0

But then
Event and on value Death_Star_1 = Ob1Death (doesn't really tell you much - we don't want to make complicated names for every fight??

This is what we're already doing for Battles though, so that's good

Nice other queries:
diedDuring some Duel
diedDuring some (Event and location value Death_Star_1)
diedDuring some (date value 0)
killedDuring some (Fight and victor value Maul)

We can still keep it local if the event is not worthy of note:
Aurra_Sing -> diedIn some (Murder and victoryOf value Tobias_Beckett and date some xsd:int[> -21, < 10])
