Some general modelling principles

People
 - property assertions between people on the one it affects most (eg the one who died in a fight) unless Event called for
 - should all have at least one Role (whether or not in an organisation)

from (where born/grew up)
 - Not asserting at class level where people/creatures are from unless wookipedia is adamant - migration common in SW
