# General modelling principles

## People
 - property assertions between people on the one it affects most (eg the one who died in a fight) unless Event called for
 - should all have at least one Role (whether or not in an organisation)

## from (where born/grew up)
 - Not asserting at class level where people are from unless wookipedia is adamant
 - migration common in SW
 - but, we can use homeworld at the class level

## tense
 - properties should be in past tense "A long time ago..."

## Event focussed
 - events within events using subX during X - not other way round
 - assertions about involvement attached to the Event, not the person? Unless the event is not worth naming

## Force ghosts/connections

    participant some (Force_spirit and (connectedTo value Obi-Wan_Kenobi))
    participant some (The_Force and (connectedTo value Leia_Organa))
