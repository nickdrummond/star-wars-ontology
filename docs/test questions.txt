Some test questions:

Is Anakin from Tatooine? (asserted he's from Mos Espa) - yes due to prop chain on from
But is Anakin from the Outer Rim? SHOULD BE YES

Members of Rebels/Resistance etc? Mixture of membership and roles

Places - City and location value Outer_Rim = Cloud City etc

Born/died before an event? Can we do this relative to an event - ie better than "died some xsd:int[>0]"

Who is related to Anakin Skywalker?
- Should include Ben Solo.
- Also includes Han Solo (as Ben's Father) as related is transitive. Should it?
- Rex is related to Jango Fett

Someone who was killed during an event died on the date of that event
- need to infer "died" from event
- eg Plo Koon died in Order 66 on 19BBY
- doesn't look like you can use property chains for datatype properties

killedDuring some (Fight and on value Death_Star_1)
