Some test questions:

Is Anakin from Tatooine? (asserted he's from Mos Espa) - yes due to prop chain on from
But is Anakin from the Outer Rim? SHOULD BE YES

Members of Rebels/Resistance etc? Mixture of membership and roles

Places - City and location value Outer_Rim = Cloud City etc

Born/died before an event? Can we do this relative to an event - ie better than "died some xsd:int[>0]"

Who is related to Anakin Skywalker?
- Should include Ben Solo.
- Also includes Han Solo (as Ben's Father) as related is transitive. Should it?
- Rex is related to Jango Fett
