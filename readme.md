# Project Convor - Star Wars Ontology

[Convor](https://www.star-wars-ontology.co.uk/classes/-1326117872/), as in "OWL in Star Wars".

A hand-built [OWL ontology](docs/benefits.md) focused on events and covering characters, places and things in the films and TV series.

[Browse the ontology](https://www.star-wars-ontology.co.uk/)
This allows you to navigate asserted content, search and query the ontologies.

* [docs](docs/) - notes on specific modelling issues, discussion of the benefits of using OWL, and working docs
* [ontologies](ontologies/) - Ontologies in ttl (Turtle) OWL format. Start with [all.owl.ttl](ontologies/all.owl.ttl)
* [src/test](https://github.com/nickdrummond/star-wars-ontology/tree/master/src/test) - A set of Java tests against the ontology for quality checking etc

* [sparql](sparql/) - A set of Sparql queries to summarise or infer things about our ontology

## Usage

### Browse

[https://www.star-wars-ontology.co.uk/](https://www.star-wars-ontology.co.uk/)

Please be patient with queries - this is hosted on cheap(ish) hobby-level hosting which I pay for
myself and receive no funding.

Browser contains [all.owl.ttl](ontologies/all.owl.ttl) and it's imports closure
(not [behind-the-scenes.owl.ttl](ontologies/behind-the-scenes.owl.ttl))

For efficiency, the query page only includes [event.owl.ttl](ontologies/events.owl.ttl) and
its imports - see [docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md)

#### Local browsing with Docker and ontology browser

Clone this repository.
From the root of this project, build a docker image and run it with:
```
docker build -t nickdrummond/star-wars-ontology .
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 nickdrummond/star-wars-ontology
```
Then browse to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to see the ontology browser.

### Edit/reason
* Open [all.owl.ttl](ontologies/all.owl.ttl) with open-source OWL editor, [Protege](https://protege.stanford.edu/) or
  another semantic web editor/browser
* Set the default reasoner to classify/reason with as `Pellet` on events.owl
* See [tools](docs/tools.md) for other tool related discussion
